# Unit test of a simple growth
- Balanced number of particles
- 5 minutes simulation
- Growth dynamics with Pore pressure
- No divisions
- Sample with 15 mm length

# Comments
No visible movements, since the simulation is quite short
> Develop a new settings with less particles, a shorter growth region 
and a visible growth at the tip
