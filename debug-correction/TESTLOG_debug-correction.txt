# 11/01 Initialisation implementation
Introduction variables: OK
Read from XML: OK
Growth parameters: ptu = 0, stu = 1

# Run-test

# Run-time
T = 2, time_comp = 9 minutes

# First implementation of the switch
- Run control: typeC = 1
L1e5 is a wee to high, particles are unstable at the tip
- Run Zero: typeC = 0
The root tip takes off. It seems that the correction is keeping it down but 
certains particles suffers from possibly badly inverted matrices

# Second Implement DFPM_scratch
Simple modification of ComputeNSPH where all non diagonal elements of Mp1 are
set to zero
- Run DFPM_s
A third, different and unstable result
There does not seem to be any bug in the formulation
>> Is it just the tip an unstable setting that would be solved by refinement ?
- Refinement with Frobenius norm (sum sum aij^2)
There are correction matrices with a difference more than 1 in the Frobenius 
error from from the beginning
_The correction is helpless in this situation_
The problem lies maybe in the [density update]
>> Check also the volume variation due to the mass intake

# A test solely on pore pressure
p100 generates a stable visible deformation the 5 first steps
The full correction improves visibly the connection to the boundary with the 
turgor only test. The DFPM leads to an even better.
However, he DFPM _completely changes_ the results: it buldges like an 
isotropic/anisotropic mix. Something is definitely odd.
>> Review the mass control (tiny variations are found)

# E test: pore pressure, sample 7.5 long, 
> consider T++, Tx2 on cluster
